| DAY    | STATUS | PROBLEM | DESCRIPTION
| :--------:| :-------: | :-------: | :------- |
|  12/12/2025 |  😀  | 2239 | Solved, but i need to look for some ideas because i could't think how to verify whether the abs(number) was in the list, and when it was true, how to return the greater number  |
|  13/12/2025 |  😀  | 1768 | Solved using string concatenations, after a saw that could be solved using list, reducing the time complexity at O(N), where  N is the length of word1 plus length word2, respectively |
|  14/12/2025 |  😀  | 13 | I was able to resolve this question without help, but afterwards see other solutions i noticed that i could've solved without a extra IF statement outside the while loop   |
