# My progress into data structure and algorithms

| DAY    | STATUS | PROBLEM | DESCRIPTION
| :--------:| :-------: | :-------: | :------- |
|  12/12/2025 |  😀  | 2239 | Solved, but i need to look for some ideas because i could't think how to verify whether the abs(number) was in the list, and when it was true, how to return the greater number  |
|  13/12/2025 |  😀  | 1768 | Solved using string concatenations, after a saw that could be solved using list, reducing the time complexity at O(N), where  N is the length of word1 plus length word2, respectively |
|  14/12/2025 |  😀  | 13 | I was able to resolve this question without help, but afterwards see other solutions i noticed that i could've solved without a extra IF statement outside the while loop   |
|  14/12/2025 |  😀  | 392 | Solved without external help, but, i wrote len(s) == 0 and len(t) >= 0; the second condition is unnecessary, because the string length(t) will be zero or greater than zero. Another tweak was len(s) > len(t) rather than len(s) > 0 and len(t) == 0 which i had been written, because the old way wouldn't catch: len(s) = 4; len(t) = 3, for example, causing unnecessary loop  |
|  15/12/2025 |  🤔  | 121 | I could think about a solution but the algorithm is still confusing |
